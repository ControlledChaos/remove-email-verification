## Remove Email Verification removes the need for new Multisite accounts to be activated by email.

Eliminate problems associated with email systems blocking activation emails. Email filters on corporate and education domains are very strict and often block activation emails. Remove Email Verification provides a fast simple fix.

### Proven results

When activation emails are not received it causes frustration and can be perceived as a bug in your system. This breaks trust with new clients and users that you work hard to acquire.

*   Stop losing clients to other services
*   Eliminate user frustration
*   Build and maintain trust
*   Free-up support staff
*   Streamline registration

### Block Sploggers

What about splogs?  Sploggers get around email verification with ease.  At the end of the day email verification is no protection at all from automated splog signups. Get real protection with [anti-splog](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/anti-splog/) and make sure real users can register with speed.
